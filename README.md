# ok-diffusion

Building a diffusion model from the ground up in hopes to better understand architecture. Control NET's release a few weeks ago got my attention to how intricate and difficult it is to explain the blackbox of generative images a.k.a. AI art.

Documenting path here. Been bad with that on other projects.

Let's see where this goes. 
Tools: Will be using pyTorch primarily.
